# Primary Goal:

The idea is to explain something, typically a portion of the the
architecture of a project, to someone else.

# Approach:

Transform an input edn file into a web page.

The input includes html, hiccup, or referenes to plantuml files.

# Usage and Example:

https://bherrmann7.github.io/explainer/

# Future directions:

Allow output to be more adapted for slides and giving talks (aka
breaking the content into pages with subpages.)

Perhaps someday it will include a "plant uml step generator" - which
allows a presenter to step through a plantuml diagram in a series of
steps.  Like layers on an overhead projector (for people who are that
old.)
